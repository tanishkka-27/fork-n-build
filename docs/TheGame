### 📝 Description
**Guess the Number** 
             is a command-line based game written in the C programming language. The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player must guess the number. After each guess, the program gives feedback whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

This project was created to apply basic programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, random number generation, and user input/output.
